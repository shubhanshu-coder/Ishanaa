Ishanna 

A Project based on Open CV platform in Python.

Designed a fully funtional project to describe shortest path between the intial and final point and also to sketch it for you.

Used Dijkstra algorithm to dsecribe the shortest path between the intial and final points.

Open CV used to sketch the path that Dijkstra algo defines just like google Maps.

Used NumPy Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
